## 🔒 Tips for Safer Use

Smart habits protect your Roblox account regardless of which executor you use:

1. **Always test on an alt account first** — Before running new scripts on your main account, verify behavior on a secondary account you don't mind losing
2. **Keep the executor updated** — Running an outdated build is the #1 cause of detection after Roblox patches; the auto-updater handles this, but verify your version after major Roblox updates
3. **Avoid obvious exploiting in public servers** — Teleporting, flying, and spawning items visibly in crowded public servers generates player reports that trigger manual Roblox review
4. **Whitelist before extracting** — Add the executor folder to antivirus exclusions before unzipping — quarantined DLLs mid-session cause crashes and can flag your account
5. **Use private servers for farming** — For **roblox executor grow a garden pc** auto-farm sessions, use private servers to eliminate exposure to other players
6. **Don't run untrusted scripts** — The executor being safe doesn't protect you from malicious Lua scripts that target your session cookies; only execute scripts from the built-in hub or well-known community sources
7. **Never share your .ROBLOSECURITY cookie** — No legitimate executor, including this one, requires your session cookie to function; any tool that asks for it is a credential stealer
8. **Rotate servers periodically** — For long AFK farming sessions, switching servers every few hours prevents sustained behavioral pattern flags on your account
